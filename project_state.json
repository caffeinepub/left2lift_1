  "summary": "From Waste to Plate – Maharashtra Edition — a hackathon-level AI-powered food redistribution platform focused on Maharashtra cities (Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kolhapur). Connects restaurants, hostels, event organizers, and households with verified NGOs, local trusts, and volunteer drivers. Built with React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion frontend, Firebase/Supabase backend, OpenAI API for spoilage prediction and AI summaries, Google Maps API for route optimization, and Web Speech API for voice input. Features: AI food safety engine with Maharashtra climate factor, Haversine-based nearest NGO finder with urgency scoring, route optimization, volunteer smart assignment, real Maharashtra demo data, glassmorphism design with animations, multi-language support (English/Hindi/Marathi), dark mode, emergency mode, impact dashboard with animated charts, donor leaderboard, and admin analytics.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Donation record stores matched NGO principal ID; NGO panel filters by that principal",
    "Spoilage thresholds: Refrigerated=24h, RoomTemperature=6h, Hot=4h; lower for perishable types",
    "NGO matching scores by food type preference match (weight 2x) + available capacity ratio",
    "Status changes (by admin or NGO) are stored on the single donation record visible to all roles",
    "Design uses greens and oranges only — no blue or purple",
    "New tech stack: React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion frontend, Firebase/Supabase backend, OpenAI API for AI logic, Google Maps API for routing, Web Speech API for voice input",
    "Geolocation uses real lat/lng coordinates and Haversine formula for NGO distance calculation",
    "Hardcoded Maharashtra NGO sample data for Mumbai (Robin Hood Army, Roti Bank, Feeding India), Pune (Annadaan Foundation, Seva Sahayog), Nagpur (Bhojan Seva Trust, Green Nagpur NGO)",
    "Four roles: Donor (restaurant/hostel/household), NGO, Volunteer, Admin",
    "Glassmorphism card design with Framer Motion animations and micro-interactions; smooth CSS transitions are permitted"
